# ruby-node-alpine
Self explanatory, ruby build on top of nodejs and alpine image

This will be a great base image for people working with rails applications. 
You could get away from using therubyracer gem by using a pre-built nodejs for the javascript V8 engine. 

Hope this will help others in the future.
